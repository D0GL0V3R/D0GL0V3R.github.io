# Positive Hack Camp 2025 — Moscow

## How I Ended Up in a Hacker Camp in Moscow

### The question I get the most: *“Wan Yin, how did you even hear about Positive Hack Camp 2025?”*

The short answer? — **Through Connection.**

The long answer? 

I joined the Malaysia Cybersecurity Camp (MCC) back in 2024 and got introduced to **RE:HACK** — a cybersecurity community. One day, Mr. Ahmad Ashraff bin Ahmad shared a link about this “Positive Hack Camp” in Moscow through the community Discord and that tiny moment snowballed into a full-on adventure.

### My reaction when I got accepted  

Honestly? **Shocked** and **grateful**. Initially, I didn’t even plan to register — I mean, Moscow? That’s halfway across the planet and I don't even speak the language. But one of my seniors persuaded me, and I thought, *“Well, there’s no harm in trying.”* 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I’m sitting here in Russia. Talk about the butterfly effect 🦋 — from a Discord ping to standing in front of the Red Square, wondering how I got here.

# Experience of the Camp

### Let me just say this: *VIP Treatment for Broke Students*

Here’s the thing: if this camp wasn’t free, I wouldn’t be here. Period. 🙃

Positive Hack Camp covered everything except the flight — and when I say everything, I mean:

- **Free 5-star hotel stay** — I thought we’d have to share rooms, but nope. Each of us got our own individual room. I nearly cried.

- **Free mealsss** — We’re talking fancy dinners, beautiful buffets, and enough variety to make me forget my own kitchen back home. (Jk, I still misses Malaysian food very much 😋)

- **Free transport** — Shuttle buses, private coaches, all covered.

- **Free training** — Actual hands-on hacking lessons taught by professionals.

- **Free tours** — They didn’t just lock us in a classroom; we actually got to see Moscow!!! 

Positive Technologies must have a magic amount of fund because they treated us like VIP guests. I mean, one minute I’m a broke diploma student in Kuala Lumpur, the next I’m sipping soup in a chandelier-lit dining hall in Moscow. Life is wild.

And yes — on arrival, I was still suspicious. Seventeen hours of flying and jet lag had me side-eyeing everything. For a good few hours, I wondered if I had just fallen for the world’s most elaborate cybersecurity scam. I didn’t fully relax until we checked in and they handed me my own keycard for my own hotel room.
